# Asynchronous FIFO Flow Summary
Sep 2021 - Present

- Design: Modular, Parameterizable, and Configurable flags at runtime.
- Testbench: 3 modes of testing, uncorrelated clocks, and random inputs.
- Lint and CDC Checks.
- Complete timing constraints in the form of SDC
- Logic Synthesis using Controlled Optimization Techniques.
- Multi-mode DFT Architecture, DRC clean, and good Coverage Estimation.
- Stuck At ATPG Pattern generation And Validation with SDF back annotated delay.
- Logic Equivalence Checking.
- Currently working on At Speed Fault.
