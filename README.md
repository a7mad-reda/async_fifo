# Asynchronous FIFO Project Summary
Sep 2021 - Present

- Design: Modular, Parameterizable, and Configurable flags at runtime.
- Testbench: 3 modes of testing, uncorrelated clocks, and random inputs.
- Lint and CDC Checks.
- Complete timing constraints in the form of SDC
- Logic Synthesis using Controlled Optimization Techniques.
- Multi-mode DFT Architectures, on-chip clock controller, Scan Compression.
- Logic Equivalence Checking.
- ATPG for " Stuck-At Transition Small-Delay-Defects Path_Delay IDDQ " fault models.
- Patterns Validation with SDF back annotated delay.
- Currently working on low power flow, UPF.
