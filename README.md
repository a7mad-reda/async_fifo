# Asynchronous FIFO Project Summary
Sep 2021 - Present

- Design: Modular, Parameterizable, and Configurable flags at runtime.
- Simple Testbench: 3 modes of testing, uncorrelated clocks, and random inputs.
- UVM based TB: Complete environment, Callbacks, Virtual sequences, SVA, RAL, and Coverage.
- Lint and CDC Checks.
- Complete timing constraints in the form of SDC
- Logic Synthesis using Controlled Optimization Techniques.
- Multi-mode DFT Architectures, On-Chip Clock Controller, Scan Compression.
-    => 3 Basic Scan Modes - 1 Compression Scan Mode.
- Logic Equivalence Checking.
- ATPG for " Stuck-At Transition Small-Delay-Defects Path_Delay IDDQ " fault models.
- Patterns Validation with SDF back annotated delay.
- Currently working on low power flow, UPF.
